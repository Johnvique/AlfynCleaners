                              This includes wiping down windowsills, baseboards, blinds and more. Our experts scrub and remove soap scum from your shower, tub, tile and grout. Next, we focus on the sink by wiping down the vanity, mirror and countertops to remove all water spots, toothpaste and buildup. Perhaps most importantly, we clean the entire toilet inside and out – you’re welcome! We finish by vacuuming bathmats and mopping the bathroom floor to remove hair and debris. We even go the extra mile by polishing faucets, drains caps and towel holders.</p>
